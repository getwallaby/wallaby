* failed getters should raise (descriptive) exceptions
* Param verification on Feature -- it should be impossible to:
  ** modify a feature's param mappings so that they include two conflicting params
  ** install two features on a group if so doing would result in two conflicting parameters would be enabled in the group's configuration
* Nodes w/o configuration should return empty config not error
* Dirty lists
* Events
* Snapshots
* ValidateConfig
* Remove Pool methods
* Implied subsystems on Feature
* GetNode creates node objects for unknown nodes
* Empty parameter to Node::CheckConfigVersion should produce an event for the
  node to check in for it's configuration
* StringSet Param type.  Allows concatenating different values for a param
  into a single value (needed for DAEMON_LIST)
* Check for cycles in feature inclusion/dependency (currently we only check for cycles of length 1)
